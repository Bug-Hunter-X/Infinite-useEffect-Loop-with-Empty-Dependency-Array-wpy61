This repository demonstrates a common React bug where an useEffect hook runs infinitely even with an empty dependency array. The bug is caused by a missing return statement in the useEffect's cleanup function. The solution demonstrates how to correctly implement the cleanup function to prevent this issue.  The bug is subtle and can be difficult to track down, highlighting the importance of careful useEffect implementation.
